    "3. Sets - Use sets when you don't care about the order of items, but we care about not having duplicates.\n",
    "4. Tuples are ordered, do allow duplicates but we can't change the number of items within a tuple. So use this structure when you have data that won't change at all, the order matters. Lastly use tuples when you need to access it quickly. This is because accessing data from a tuple is much quicker than a list when there's lots of data."
