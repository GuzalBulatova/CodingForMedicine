Empirical results on two large-scale datasets of scientific papers show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.\",\\n}\\n', homepage='https://github.com/armancohan/long-summarization', license='', features={'article': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'abstract': Value(dtype='string', id=None)}, post_processed=None, supervised_keys=None, task_templates=None, builder_name='pubmed-summarization', config_name='section', version=1.0.0, splits={'train': SplitInfo(name='train', num_bytes=2257744955, num_examples=119924, shard_lengths=[27000, 27000, 27000, 27000, 11924], dataset_name='pubmed-summarization'), 'validation': SplitInfo(name='validation', num_bytes=127711559, num_examples=6633, shard_lengths=None, dataset_name='pubmed-summarization'), 'test': SplitInfo(name='test', num_bytes=127486937, num_examples=6658, shard_lengths=None, dataset_name='pubmed-summarization')}, download_checksums={'train.zip': {'num_bytes': 779257354, 'checksum': '988355271552520ad30fab4c2d63a3ef8d985a179e30089da766ee04ec017a10'}, 'val.zip': {'num_bytes': 43705498, 'checksum': '37a0b6b2c2f9b3fc8296f2d244ec813664571e7ef5bec8cf015626c83e485460'}, 'test.zip': {'num_bytes': 43787908, 'checksum': 'fa6666b57d2335a1962f2d8a8511a7bf5f6e457215323645be62457ce8bbfcdf'}}, download_size=866750760, post_processing_size=None, dataset_size=2512943451, size_in_bytes=3379694211),\n",

       "  preliminary studies suggest that survival and loco - regional control after radiation therapy , especially in head and neck cancers , may be compromised by anemia.24 anemia often worsens symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , and dyspnea , and thus may have a negative effect on quality of life ( qol ) and performance status in patients with cancer . \n",
       "  thus , to improve physical functioning , qol , and prognosis in patients with cancer , it would be reasonable to take a proactive approach in identifying populations who need treatment for cancer - associated anemia ( caa ) and provide timely management . \n",

       "  in addition , the use of esas often causes concern about severe adverse reactions.6,8 in several studies , esas were found to shorten overall survival time , or time to tumor progression in patients whose hb level reached more than 12 g / dl . \n",
       "  these studies included patients with different primary cancers , such as breast , lung , head and neck , cervix , and lymphomas.911 the lack of response to erythropoietin stimulation in patients with cancer is partly attributed to the functional iron deficiency state , in which the high rate of erythropoiesis exceeds the delivery of usable iron , despite adequate iron stores.12 absolute iron deficiency , in contrast , occurs when iron delivery is impaired because iron stores are depleted ( serum ferritin , < 100 ng / ml ; transferring saturation , < 20%).13 hepcidin , a peptide hormone produced by the liver , is up - regulated in chronic inflammatory states including cancer . \n",
       "  hepcidin inhibits iron transport across cell membranes , thus decreasing the accessibility of stored iron and gastrointestinal absorption of dietary iron , leading to an increased frequency of iron - restricted erythropoiesis.1416 many randomized trials examined the role of intravenous ( iv ) iron in addition to esas in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer . \n",

       "  \",\"lepidoptera include agricultural pests that , through feeding and other activities , negatively affect stored grains , food and fiber crops [ 2 , 3 ] . since a single lepidoptera adult can produce hundreds of eggs , and their primary food source is typically plant material , they can cause significant damage to agricultural crops . although biological agents can help manage these insect pests , insecticides currently are essential for large - scale effective and economical pest control . \n",
       "  these insecticides can also affect non - target organisms , including pollinators , and their application not only disrupts natural ecosystems but also reduces yields of crops that rely on pollination [ 5 , 6 ] . \n",
       "  the non - target effect of some pesticides is in part due to their effects on insect immunity , which is necessary for insect survival in natural environments . \n",
       "  for example , currently used pesticides have been shown to affect cellular [ 710 ] and humoral [ 11 , 12 ] immune responses and interfere with grooming behavior [ 13 , 14 ] . \n",
       "  these effects on immunity are likely non - specific and negatively impact the health of both the target pest and beneficial arthropods . \n",
       "  therefore , there is a need for novel target - specific approaches to control insect pests without affecting beneficial arthropods . \n",
       "  although immune pathways can be generally and non - specifically inhibited by pesticides , they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target - specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes , including signaling pathways , can be under strong selection for diversification . \n",
       "  fundamental mechanisms of innate immunity comprising cellular and humoral pathways are conserved throughout the animal kingdom   and are controlled by signaling pathways activated by various stimuli [ 17 , 18 ] , including pathogen recognition by immune surveillance systems . despite this overall conservation , \n",
       "  aspects of immune systems are subject to strong selection to evolve in response to varying pathogen exposure and to pathogen evolution of virulence determinants that modulate immunity [ 15 , 1921 ] \n",
       "  . such co - evolutionary dynamics can promote diversification of conserved elements of immunity as well as the recruitment of novel effectors . \n",
       "  as such , the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition . \n",
       "  for example , the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila suppresses cellular and humoral immunity in the lepidopteran moths manduca sexta and spodoptera exigua [ 23 , 24 ] but not in the dipteran fly drosophila melanogaster , suggesting the stage of immunity suppressed by x. nematophila may be absent from d. melanogaster , but present in lepidoptera . \n",
       "  since dipteran flies serve as pollinators [ 26 , 27 ] , decomposers , food sources for other animals , and pest control agents , capitalizing on the possible differences between dipteran and lepidopteran immune signaling cascades will help in the identification of targets for pest - specific inhibition . with this knowledge in hand , \n",
       "  pest management can be achieved by developing small molecule inhibitors of these targets that will suppress pest insect immunity and lead to increased susceptibility to environmental pathogens . \n",
       "  indeed , many insecticides may contribute to insect ( target and non - target ) death by modulating aspects of immunity . \n",
       "  the feasibility of targeted pest control via insect immune inhibition has been established for termites ; a small molecule inhibitor of an immune surveillance protein led to faster termite death upon exposure to various pathogens . \n",
       "  much of our current knowledge of insect immune signaling pathways and receptor and effector function is based on the premiere model organism d. melanogaster , for which there are extensive genetic tools and several fully sequenced genomes . \n",
       "  well - established lepidopteran insect models such as the silkworm bombyx mori and the tobacco hornworm m. sexta also have been widely used to study insect immunity . \n",
       "  these organisms have been particularly useful for investigating hemolymph proteins and hemocyte function because of their relatively large larval size and hemolymph volume . \n",
       "  many insects in the order lepidoptera are easy to rear in laboratory conditions , and new tools such as rna interference have been implemented successfully to study genetics of their immune systems [ 30 , 31 ] . also , their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data [ 3238 ] . \n",

       "  in insects , the cellular immune response includes phagocytosis , nodulation and encapsulation [ 3942 ] and the humoral response involves the expression of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) [ 43 , 44 ] as well as the pro - phenol oxidase ( propo ) proteolytic cascade that results in formation of melanized nodules and toxic reactive compounds [ 45 , 46 ] . \n",
       "  amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby killing and clearing pathogens . \n",
       "  they are synthesized by hemocytes and to a greater extent in fat body from which they are released into the insect hemolymph rapidly after microbial infection [ 43 , 47 ] . \n",
       "  amps are also expressed in extra - embryonic tissues of eggs , which may help protect the developing embryo from infection . \n",
       "  amps are a conserved component of immunity in plants   and animals   and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins , attacins , defensins and diptericins . \n",

       "  each of these pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) that trigger , through complex regulatory cascades , nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) dependent transcription of the genes encoding amps . \n",
       "  after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect . \n",
       "  bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp - inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans , though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta [ 32 , 35 ] . \n",
       "  the conserved presence of amps in immunity coupled with the possibility that certain elements of their induction pathways may vary among insects enhances the probability that microbially - induced amp expression could be inhibited in a pest - specific manner . as such , for the remainder of this review we focus on pathways leading to amp gene expression . \n",

       "  however , using warfarin is not easy ; effort is needed to educate patients about drug and dietary interactions , and serial monitoring of the international normalization ratio ( inr ) is required . as a result , \n",
       "  a recent population - based cohort study showed that 43% of patients stopped warfarin within 3 years and 61% within 5 years.1 in addition , warfarin has a narrow therapeutic threshold , and the quality of anticoagulation has a critical influence on its effect . in a uk cohort study , warfarin therapy with a time in therapeutic range ( ttr ) of inr of less than 60% \n",
       "  did not significantly reduce stroke risk compared to no antithrombotic therapy.2 in a post hoc analysis of active w ( atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trial with irbesartan for prevention of vascular events ) , in order to ensure the superiority of warfarin over clopidogrel plus aspirin the minimum projected ttr threshold was 58%.3 while suboptimal doses lead to an increased risk of ischemic stroke , overdosing frequently results in hemorrhage that can be fatal . even in the setting of clinical trials , \n",
       "  the reported ttrs were only about two thirds.4,5,6,7 it also has been shown that eight adverse bleeding events are estimated to occur annually for every 100 patients treated,8 and the underutilization of warfarin is in part due to concerns about hemorrhagic risk . \n",
       "  lastly , the use of warfarin is particularly cumbersome in old subjects and in those with stroke . \n",
       "  they are more vulnerable to bleeding complications that may be related with poor compliance , cognitive impairment , and the frequent presence of comorbid diseases that require polypharmacy and invasive procedures . in subjects undergoing invasive treatment , \n",
       "  periprocedural management is difficult and carries a high risk for thromboembolism , partly because of the slow onset and offset of action ( long half - life ) of warfarin . \n",
       "  therefore , more ideal anticoagulants are required that have a wide therapeutic range , a short half - life , and a predictable therapeutic effect with fixed or weight - based dosing , without significant food or drug interaction.9 \n",
       "  several warfarin alternatives have been tested but failed to show benefits because of serious adverse effects , i.e. , excessive bleeding with idraparinux10 or hepatic dysfunction with ximelagatran.11 new oral anticoagulants ( noacs ) ( dabigatran , apixaban , rivaroxaban , and edoxaban ) were first introduced in 2005 , for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement surgery , and are now used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism ( table 1).12 more recently , four large phase iii randomized controlled trials of noacs ( re - ly , rocket - af , aristotle , and engage - af - timi 48 ) have been completed in patients with non - valvular af.4,5,6,7 overall , noacs were superior or non - inferior to warfarin in the prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism , but superior to warfarin in reducing hemorrhagic stroke.4,5,6,7 noacs may be more beneficial among patients with af - related stroke or transient ischemic attack ( tia ) ; a recent meta - analysis showed that noacs significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolism , as well as hemorrhagic stroke or major bleeding , in patients with af and previous stroke or tia.13 the relative risk reduction and the number needed to treat with noacs vs. warfarin to reduce stroke / systemic embolism were estimated to be 14% and 134 patients ; for avoiding hemorrhagic stroke the respective values were 57.9% and 139 patients.13 evidence from these trials forms the basis for national and international guidelines for the management of patients with non - valvular af in clinical practice . \n",
       "  although aspirin was preferred in patients with a low - risk of stroke , new and safer anticoagulants may lead to lowering of the threshold for anticoagulation.14 the selection of antithrombotic agent ( warfarin vs. noacs ) should be individualized on the basis of risk factors , cost , tolerability , patient preference , potential for drug interactions , and other clinical characteristics such as renal function and ttr.15 it would be unnecessary to switch from warfarin to noacs in patients who already achieve stable and good inr control with warfarin . \n",
       "  good anticoagulation control ( ttr>70% ) is associated with the best efficacy and safety of warfarin,2 and the recent meta - analysis of the four phase iii noacs trials showed that there was a greater relative reduction in major bleeding with noacs when the ttr was less than 66% than when it was greater.16 \n",
       "  first of all , it appears that asians more often have cerebral small vessel disease , which is prone to bleeding . \n",
       "  it has been shown that hemorrhagic stroke ( intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage ) , which accounts for 15% to 20% of strokes in whites,17 is more frequent among asians.18 death from hemorrhagic stroke is also much more common in asians.19 the prevalence of cerebral microbleeds , which increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage on anticoagulation , also appears to be higher in asian than in white population.20 the ethnic differences in bleeding - prone small artery disease are in part related with the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension or hypocholesterolemia in this region.21 ethnic differences in the salt sensitivity of intracranial hemorrhage ( ich ) have also been addressed.22 whatever the reason , these small artery diseases predispose patients to cerebral bleeding when they are given antithrombotics ; the presence of cerebral small artery diseases , such as lacunar infarcts , white matter ischemia or microbleeds , increases the risk of ich in patients receiving antiplatelet agents23 or anticoagulants.24,25 a recent study showed a high prevalence of warfarin - associated ich in asians , even if the inr levels were comparable ; the hazard ratio for ich was 4.06 for asians , and 2 for hispanics and blacks compared to whites.26 considering that noacs have a lower bleeding risk than warfarin , the benefit of noacs may be greater in asian patients . \n",
       "  second , asians generally favor complementary treatment , such as herbal medication and healthy food . according to a study from korea , \n",
       "  40% of patients who were initially treated in a large tertiary hospital tried additional herbal treatment after discharge.27 this is in strong contrast to a report from canada , where patients with cerebrovascular diseases rarely used alternative medicine.28 a study from hong kong found that 26% of patients taking warfarin had ingested herbal remedies.29 this behavior probably results in significant warfarin - drug / food interaction , poor inr control , and may at least in part explain the lower ttr achievement in asian ( mean 54.5% ) than in non - asian ( 66.2% ) patients in the re - ly trial.30,31 as asians more often had a lower ( rather than higher ) inr level , another explanation would be that asian physicians tend to target a relatively low inr because of the fear of bleeding complications . indeed \n",
       "  , japanese guidelines recommend a target inr of 1.6 - 2.6 for japanese people.32 whatever the reason , inr control is relatively poor in asia , which also supports the notion that noacs may be more suitable for asians . \n",
       "  finally , there has been evidence that population frequencies of genetic polymorphisms related with warfarin metabolism and action ( e.g. , cyp2c9 and vkorc1 ) differ according to ethnicities.33,34,35 apart from being linked to ethnic variations in the required warfarin dose , these differences may also partly explain the poor inr control and the higher risk of ich among asians . \n",
       "  recent studies report that noacs may be particularly valuable in asians compared to non - asians.31,36,37 the re - ly investigators reported that , among patients treated with warfarin , asians ( vs. non - asians ) had higher rates of ischemic stroke ( by 2.1-fold ) as well as hemorrhagic stroke ( by 2.4-fold ) , despite similar blood pressure , younger age , and relatively lower inr values . \n",
       "  the magnitude of the benefit from dabigatran in the prevention of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic was greater in asians than in non - asians.31 more recently , chiang and colleagues reported a post - hoc analysis of the asian population included in the re - ly and arisotle trials , which showed that , compared to non - asians , asians had a lower number needed to treat with noacs vs. warfarin to reduce stroke / systemic embolism , and a higher number needed to treat to avoid hemorrhagic complications , favoring their use in asians in terms of both efficacy and safety.38 \n",
       "  cost - effectiveness analyses showed that noacs are cost - effective relative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with af and stroke / tia.39,40,41 cost - effectiveness is associated with the cost of the drug , care costs , the loss of productivity due to disability following recurrent disease , individual patient risk for thromboembolism and bleeding , and the quality of anticoagulation control ( i.e. , ttr ) which in turn is related to compliance , warfarin pharmacogenomics , and accessibility for regular inr tests . \n",
       "  we suggest that noacs may be particularly cost - effective in asian stroke patients for the following reasons . \n",
       "  first , the risk of both recurrent thromboembolism and bleeding is higher in stroke patients than in patients without stroke . \n",
       "  moreover , as discussed above , asians are at higher risk of warfarin - related ich , a devastating condition , than caucasians . \n",
       "  second , patients with af - related stroke have a poorer control of inr than those without stroke , probably because of more severe neurological disability and a lack of access to frequent inr monitoring . \n",
       "  it has been shown that most ( > 70% ) af - related stroke patients have lobar or territorial infarcts,42 and poor anticoagulation control is associated with the size of brain infarcts ( figure 1).43 thus , asian stroke patients more often face problems in using warfarin : difficulty in maintaining inr and frequent bleeding complications . in this \n",
       "  . however , noacs are expensive drugs and studies focusing on the cost - effectiveness of noacs in asian stroke patients are unavailable . \n",
       "  nevertheless , given the considerations so far discussed , we propose that the reimbursement policy for the use of noacs should be more generous for asian stroke patients . \n",
       "  the guidelines for the reimbursement of noacs are summarized in table 2 . in japan , taiwan , norway , \n",
       "  switzerland , iceland , and the united arab emirates , there is no restriction as long as noacs are prescribed on - label . \n",
       "  the reimbursement guidelines for noacs in some european countries , including the uk , france , and germany , are based only on the chads2 score ( 1 ) . \n",
       "  other european countries and canada include both chads2 score and the quality of anticoagulation control . \n",
       "  for example , the provincial reimbursement guideline for noacs in canada includes ( a ) unable to tolerate warfarin , ( b ) inrs not well controlled on warfarin , or ( c ) unable to have inrs tested regularly , in patients with a chads2 score of 2 . \n",
       "  the guidelines for the reimbursement of noacs in korea are similar to those of canada , but the accessibility ( ability to have inr tested regularly ) is not considered . the criteria for ' inadequate anticoagulation ' appear to be too strict , especially during the maintenance period ( table 3 ) . \n",
       "  as a result , it is difficult to prescribe noacs to stroke patients with severe disability , or those who live in remote areas ( e.g. , on an island ) and are thus unable to test inr regularly . \n",
       "  the guideline also recommends a frequent change of warfarin dose ( at least 5 times during 6 months ) to monitor inr . \n",
       "  this is in conflict with a randomized study comparing ttr between warfarin dose assessment every 4 weeks vs. every 12 weeks , which showed that frequent dose changes to monitor inr are unnecessary and result in temporary fluctuation of the inr.44 moreover , the guidelines state that reimbursement can be allowed if patients have a major bleeding complication during warfarin treatment . from the strokologist 's point of view this does not make sense , because warfarin - associated ich is frequently fatal . \n",
       "  we understand that the strict guidelines can be attributed to the high cost of noacs , which may adversely affects the health budget , but we would suggest that the guidelines be more generous to asian stroke patients , who are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of warfarin . \n",
       "  we suggest that this approach may be more cost - effective than not using noacs , because recurrent ischemic stroke or ich will be very costly in this rapidly aging society . \n",
       "  as discussed above , cost - effectiveness studies on asian stroke patients are unavailable and should be performed in the future to answer this question . \n",
       "  af is an emerging global epidemic in both high - income and low - income countries . \n",
       "  recently , the use of noacs in af patients has been rapidly increasing , but the cost of noacs is unaffordable in low - income to middle - income countries . \n",
       "  . however , the cost - effectiveness of noacs will depend on the characteristics of patients as well as therapy pricing . \n",
       "  asian countries are facing population aging at a pace that is unprecedented and an increasing burden of stroke , particularly af - related stroke . \n",
       "  af - related stroke is more disabling and more fatal than other stroke subtypes , and is expected to increase substantially in the decades to come ( figure 2 ) . compared to caucasians , asians more often develop hemorrhagic stroke and warfarin - related ich , as well as any stroke in the case of patients with af , and the benefit with noacs vs. warfarin for preventing stroke and reducing anticoagulation - related ich would be particularly high in asians . nevertheless , the current reimbursement guidelines are in general suboptimal . \n",
       "  we suggest that guidelines for using noacs should be more generous for asian stroke patients . \n",
       "  in addition , as noacs are expensive , continuous efforts should be made by healthcare providers and governors to find the ideal candidate for noacs ( most cost - effective group ) ; this includes research to find genetic or clinical factors that predict the quality of anticoagulation control.45,46 close communication is needed to arrive at a consensus decision regarding the coverage guideline for those patients who need noacs , and to reduce the ever - increasing burden of af - related stroke .\",\"the author has not received any funding or benefits from industry or elsewhere to conduct this study .\",\"attention to women 's health has evolved from a limited focus on reproductive and breast health to encompassing all aspects of health from birth through old age . in the era of individualized and precision medicine , innovative medical , surgical , pharmacological , regenerative , and genetic technologies are available to improve the health of women . \n",

       "  the prevalence of g6pd deficiency is between 3 and 30% in endemic countries for malaria , corresponding to 350 million people . in the americas \n",
       "  , it has a lower prevalence , varying between 5 and 10% in the amazon region and higher levels in tropical africa , middle east , and the mediterranean basin , such as sudan and congo , where it is present in more than 20% of the population . in brazil \n",

       "  a city with high levels of transmission of malaria in the brazilian amazon , the prevalence of g6pd was 2.5% . \n",
       "  this difference in prevalence may explain why , in brazil , primaquine is administered to all nonpregnant patients older than 6 months with an unknown g6pd deficiency status , while in other countries with higher prevalence of this enzymatic deficiency ( or in which more severe variants are common ) primaquine use is very much debated and controversial . \n",
       "  these events are dependent on the extent of hemolysis , which is related to the severity of g6pd deficiency and the dose of primaquine . recommended primaquine doses used to block falciparum malaria transmission ( 0.25  mg of base per kilogram ) are usually considered to have low toxicity , because it is a single - dose treatment . \n",
       "  however , primaquine use in vivax malaria , aimed at preventing relapsing events , is a longer course ( between 7 and 14 days ) , with varying dosage among malaria control policies , and therefore hemolytic events are more prone to happen . in a systematic revision , monteiro et al .   detected 47 cases of hemolytic anemia in patients using primaquine in latin america and caribbean , and 23 occurred in brazil . \n",
       "  however , brazil has the largest population at risk for malaria ; thus it is expected to have more cases reported . \n",

       "  although severe events related to the use of primaquine were infrequent in our and other studies in the amazon , it is important to bear in mind the possible adverse side effects of primaquine and also mild anemia occurring in patients with the less severe forms of g6pd deficiency , which can be associated or not with weakness . \n",
       "  reported that subjects with no g6pd deficiency showed reduction of 1 to 2  g / dl of hemoglobin after primaquine use , while in g6pd deficient patients hemoglobin levels decreased between 3 and 5  g / dl , with fast normalization after treatment was over . \n",
       "  reported abdominal pain as a side effect for primaquine in falciparum malaria patients from myanmar , occurring in 16% of patients receiving a single dose . \n",
       "  there is no clear evidence why primaquine can cause abdominal pain ; it can be related to the direct effect of the drug on an empty stomach   or related to the release of pharmacological substances during hemolysis . despite its cause , \n",
       "  it is noteworthy that , in our study , abdominal pain increased significantly from 6% to 32% after primaquine was started . \n",
       "  although the present study has a limitation in the number of subjects studied , it was possible to detect significant association of symptoms and malaria treatment . thus , while the treatment of vivax malaria with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine leads to decrease in fever and pain symptoms , it can lead to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis or enhances these symptoms when already present in the patient with malaria , contributing to reducing treatment adherence , especially during the use of primaquine , which has a longer course of treatment . \n",
       "  moreover , the sensation of itching and stinging , although they do not occur in all patients , can be quite intense , hindering treatment with chloroquine . \n",

       "  the occurrence of severe hemolysis after primaquine use , although not common in brazil , can still occur , and since brazilian control programs currently do not have a policy for g6pd deficiency screening before malaria treatment is offered , health care personnel must be aware of it to interrupt primaquine use and manage its side effects properly .\",\"surgical methods for repairing unilateral cleft lips have advanced continuously over the past few decades . \n",

       "  this laterally based flap was fashioned as a tongue of posterior mucosa that was brought across into a relaxing incision on the medial side or it could be done as an anterior onlay or  central tongue in dart. when the vermilion is attenuated , a posterior mucosal z - plasty and/or a relaxing incision behind the thin area can be used to release the mucosa . \n",
       "  he had also stressed on the importance of performing inter - digitation at the junction of the white roll ( vermilion - cutaneous junction ) , because when the vertical scar crosses this line , it causes an obvious break in colour and contour . \n",
       "  byrd and stal used techniques similar to those of millard , specifically the lateral triangular vermilion flap to augment the deficient medial vermilion . \n",
       "  in contrast to lateral vermilion flap used by millard , which consists of only mucosa , wrv flap has vermilion , orbicularis muscle and white roll as its components from the lateral lip segment . \n",
       "  this flap is sutured in the midline across the cleft allowing more embryological and anatomical closure of the vermilion of the lip [ figure 11 ] . \n",

       "  the second unilimb z - plasty is at the vermilion - mucosal junction to prevent notching . \n",
       "  this serves to augment the height of the medial vermilion and is similar to that described by noordhoff . \n",
       "  the third is a small triangular flap ( 2 - 2.5 mm at its base ) at the vermilion - cutaneous junction that carries white roll across the scar line and lowers the vermilion - cutaneous junction on the medial side of cupid 's bow . \n",
       "  wrv flap breaks the vermilion - cutaneous junction into zigzag closure both in vertical as well as in anteroposterior plane making it less prone for scar contracture , which is seen with straight line closure more often . \n",
       "  it also provides a solution to the problem of vermilion notching owing to its muscle component and the prevention of scar contracture at the mucosal aspect . \n",
       "  there is no significant variation in this technique when done for secondary cases where vermilion of the medial lip segment is scarred , lost or deficient . \n",
       "  it offers a reliable option to use vermilion with its white roll from the lateral segment for substitution on the medial side as no other method or technique can replace this tissue . \n",
       "  disadvantage of this technique only includes associated learning curve as there is need for meticulous incision ( preferably under magnification ) just above the white roll in both the segments and not to err on the thinner side while raising the wrv flap . \n",
       "  if the incision on either or both of the segments is made below the white roll , it will lead to double white roll or no white roll in the reconstructed lip , respectively . \n",
       "  the aim of the technique in this article is to identify and develop an optimal incision design in cleft lip surgery . \n",
       "  it would require prospective studies and statistical evaluation in future to grade the results when compared to conventional techniques . \n",
       "  the eurocleft study , a previously performed , large scale , multi - centric study has demonstrated that constancy of protocols in a centre leads to best outcomes . \n",
       "  any technique or modification individually can not necessarily produce the best results in all the patients but better results are achieved when they are analysed , and modifications are applied to operative principles based on experience . in presenting a modification , \n",
       "  we hope to stimulate a discussion regarding the advantages of various techniques in cleft lip surgery . \n",
       "  millard 's rotation - advancement repair has had a major impact on cleft lip surgery since the 1960s . \n",
       "  critical analysis of post - operative results led to various modifications in the technique since then . performing such modifications , while maintaining original surgical goals , has allowed the millard 's repair to remain the most popular method of cleft lip repair throughout the world . \n",
       "  wrv flap technique is effective in preventing and correcting many vermilion and white roll deformities with promising aesthetic outcome . \n",
       "  wrv flap is now the preferred method at our centre for primary cleft lip repairs for restoring what millard termed  ideal beautiful normal and for building hope while building smiles . \n",

       "  in addition , -sma is critical for wound contraction   and plays a major role in fibrosis as well , as it sustained the myofibroblasts to form the granulation tissue , which inevitably leads to fibrotic scar tissue formation . from our immunohistochemical examination and western blot analysis , \n",

       "  as fetal skin possesses the ability to regenerate completely , adults with scarless healing may need higher ratios of tgf-3 to tgf-1/2 , and our results are consistent with the above studies . other important molecules in complete healing were mmps and timps . \n",
       "  like other studies which implied that there were high levels of mmps expression in dermal fibroblasts from nude mice   and scarless wounds have a higher ratio of mmp to timp , which may be due to the decreased expression of tgf-1 , as it decreases mmp and increases timp expression , favoring collagen accumulation and scarring , our studies showed that , from the control group , plla group , and i - plla - ef group to ar - i - plla - ef group , the relative expression of mmp-1 was increased and the relative expression of timp-1 was decreased as shown in figure 8(e ) ; the ratio of mmp-1/timp-1 was increased in turn as displayed in figure 8(f ) . \n",

       "  these biological activities suggest that cgrp could play a role in promoting and supporting epithelial repair and/or pathological hypertrophy in damaged lung epithelium . with coincidental cancer - initiating gene mutations in lung epithelial cells , or perhaps even in ne cells themselves , ascl1 and cgrp working in concert along with other cellular factors which doubtless may be present , such as vegf ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) 20 , might sustain and encourage a neoplastic growth . \n",
       "  the actions of cgrp through stimulating cell proliferation , promoting angiogenesis , and enabling increased local nutritional supply through microvascular dilation might be ways in which this could occur . \n",

       "  nnk exposure in a chemical carcinogenesis hamster model induces hyperplastic increases both in size and number of airway nebs , presumably enhancing net pulmonary expressions of both ascl1 and cgrp . that actual cell proliferation is responsible for these increases is supported by nuclear co - expression of ascl1 and pcna . in the current experiments , nnk induced a variety of lung tumors , all nsclc types , which did not express detectable ne markers . \n",
       "  whether higher levels of nnk or a longer latency time is required to induce actual ne tumors , and to what extent ascl1-expressing cells might proliferate and play a developmental role in such a process , remain to be seen . \n",

       "  is the superimposition of the location of compound 2 and 8 in mao - a and mao - b binding pocket ( orange is for mao - a and magentas is for mao - b ) . although the structures of mao - a and mao - b have some similarity , there are still some key amino acids different in binding pocket ( mao - a : phe208 , ile335 ; mao - b : ile199 , tyr326 ) which cause ligands are closer to fad in mao - a than in mao - b when binding to the active site . since compound 2 with no -och3 at c-4 only has relatively weak van der waals interaction with fad in mao - a or mao - b , the distance of 2 and fad less affected the mao inhibitory activity . \n",
       "  thus , the selectivity of 2 against mao - a and mao - b is weak . \n",

       "  fiber - reinforced posts have demonstrated the ability to fracture at the coronal portion of a tooth restoration with the presence of catastrophic forces without root fracture , permitting scope of retreatment of the remaining root structure . \n",
       "  thus , the structural integrity and clinical longevity of post- and core - restored teeth are therefore strongly dependent on the state of stress created in their different regions due to occlusal loads . \n",

       "  the effect of pelvic drop is to adjust the length of the support lower limb , helped by some degree of knee flexion , avoiding excessive lower vertical displacement of the center of mass . \n",
       "  the hip abduction / adduction displacement at this moment is dependent on the pelvis movement over the femur . while hemipelvis elevation favors adduction of the stance limb , hemipelvis drop favors , on the contralateral side , hip abduction movement . \n",

       "  the summation of these actions prevents excessive pelvic drop and the trendelenburg gait . as well , when the support limb begins terminal stance and preswing phases , the opposite will occur . \n",
       "  the pelvis will begin to drop , favoring hip abduction which is important to assist the release of the foot from the ground , permitting the body to swing forward [ 22 , 24 ] . \n",
       "  therefore , pelvic obliquity and hip adduction are two mechanisms that work synchronously to maintain stability and forward movement of the body . in diplegic children with cerebral palsy , \n",
       "  reduced pelvic obliquity could be a result of abductor muscles weakness bilaterally and adductor muscles spasticity . \n",
       "  another explanation could be that , by reducing pelvic elevation on the supported limb in the stance phase of the cycle , children with cerebral palsy are probably trying to decrease leg length to facilitate the next initial contact of the same foot . \n",
       "  however , this strategy would increase inferior displacement of the center of mass cycle , resulting in a less efficient gait [ 25 , 27 ] . at the hip joint , \n",
       "  reduced hip adduction in the stance phase increases the internal abductor moment of the support limb . since children with cerebral palsy normally show weakness of the hip abductor muscles , the gait pattern would be unstable , forcing them to increase base of support or to spend less time in the unipodal phase [ 14 , 22 ] . \n",
       "  the decreased hip adduction could also be a response to alterations in pelvic obliquity , once the loaded hemipelvis is lower than normal , challenging the hip mechanics to generate hip adduction . \n",
       "  the combination of reduced pelvic obliquity and hip adduction during the stance phase of the gait cycle , reinforce the evidence that children with cerebral palsy gmfcs level ii are more unstable during gait compared to children in level i. in threatening situations , such as walking on uneven or inclined surfaces , the greater instability of children in gmfcs level ii could justify their need for assistive devices . \n",
       "  it also justifies their use a rail to walk up and down stairs , since reduced pelvic obliquity would decrease hip abduction that could also affect hip flexion . although the kinematic analysis was not a tool used to assist the development of gmfcs classification system , the findings of the present study support the differences between levels i and ii of the gmfcs , recently revised by the authors . \n",

       "\"an exponential rise in alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) prevalence rates is predicted to parallel the aging of baby boomers creating a potentially unsustainable economic burden to the healthcare system .   delaying the onset or progression of ad , even modestly , by earlier pharmacological intervention could substantially reduce the economic and psychosocial impact of the illness [ 1 , 2 ] .   unfortunately \\n , many ad patients remain undiagnosed or go undetected until the later stages of disease . \\n insights into the underlying pathological mechanisms involving beta - amyloid plaque deposition within the brain have   led to the development of a host of antiamyloid agents   that are in various stages of clinical investigation . \\n there is now a scientific consensus that the pathological events in ad initiate decades before clinical symptoms become apparent , and if disease modification is realized in the coming decades , the need for improved methods of early detection prior to the overt clinical signs will be accentuated .   traditionally , neuropsychological measures , particularly those that tap cognitive abilities subsumed by the hippocampal formation such as episodic memory , have shown usefulness in identifying cognitively normal elders who subsequently develop ad [ 4 , 5 ] . \\n decrements in semantic memory and concept formation have been shown to occur nearly a decade before the development of ad . \\n performance on visual - spatial and verbal memory measures in midlife have also been shown to predict later memory loss . \\n however , individuals with very high premorbid intellectual abilities experiencing incipient cognitive decline may go undetected , and false positives are possible in individuals with a low level of intellectual abilities . also appropriate \\n interpretation of extensive neuropsychological testing requires a high degree of expertise and training , which limits its use in routine clinical settings .   the advancement of molecular imaging tracers that bind to amyloid , such as pittsburgh compound b ( pib ) or longer - lived probes ( e.g. , fddnp ) , offers a non - invasive in vivo method to detect and quantify brain amyloid deposition [ 8 , 9 ] .   however , this approach for presymptomatic detection is economically impractical for routine use given the current costs and restrictions on  medically necessary  use . \\n similarly , biomarkers including a142 and phosphorylated tau ( also implicated in ad pathology ) in cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) can predict subsequent cognitive decline [ 10 , 11 ] , but lumbar puncture carries risks and is inconvenient for wide - scale use in cognitively impaired elderly subjects . \\n blood - based biomarkers have more practical applicability for routine use and are likely to be more cost effective than both csf and imaging procedures .   consequently , measurement of a140 and a142 in blood is increasingly being explored and shows potential in identifying individuals at the preclinical stage of ad [ 1214 ] . \\n it has been reported that csf a levels are subject to high diurnal fluctuations with extremely high variability reported over 12 hours .   over days and weeks , \\n furthermore , serum contains more a than plasma , possibly due to the release of bound a during the clotting process . \\n hence , serum a appears suitable for use in predicting mci / ad and optimal sensitivity , and specificity is probably achievable if combined with current diagnostic procedures , such as brief neuropsychological testing .    in this study \\n , we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests in combination with blood a140 and a142 as a predictive test for detecting mci / ad in at - risk older adults at a pre - symptomatic stage . \\n such an approach will be more practical for clinical use and be germane in designing large - scale prevention trials . \\n participants included a subset of subjects enrolled in the alzheimer 's disease anti - inflammatory prevention trial ( adapt ) . \\n adapt was a randomized , placebo - controlled , multicenter primary prevention trial sponsored by the national institute on aging . \\n subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups : celecoxib ( 200  mg b.i.d . ) , naproxen sodium ( 220  mg b.i.d . ) , or placebo . \\n full details of data collection , measurements , and study procedures are available at http://www.jhucct.com/adapt/manall43.pdf and described elsewhere . the inclusion criteria for adapt subjects were age of 70 or older at enrollment , a self - reported family history of ad - like dementia , and normal cognitive performance on a brief battery of neuropsychological tests . \\n recruitment for adapt began in 2002 , and the study was completed in 2007 . \\n in 2005 , the roskamp institute initiated a proteomic ancillary study ( f. crawford , pi ) involving blood draw from these subjects . \\n the inclusion criteria for this ancillary study stipulated that each subject was an active adapt participant and had met all the adapt inclusion and exclusion criteria . \\n a separate consent was also obtained from each subject who participated in the ancillary study . \\n two hundred and fifteen subjects from the roskamp adapt cohort enrolled in the proteomic ancillary study .   at the time of blood draw \\n , subjects maintained cognitively normal status as determined by their performance on an annual cognitive assessment battery . \\n blood was collected during the semi - annual followup visits , and the cognitive assessments were performed at the baseline visit and at the annual visits . \\n the time from baseline cognitive testing to the diagnosis of mci / ad was 4.06 years ( 1.3 sd ) . \\n timeframe from baseline cognitive testing to blood draw was 2.25 years ( 0.71  sd ) and from blood draw to diagnosis was 1.79 years ( 1.2 sd ) . \\n the cognitive measures completed at baseline and annual followup included the modified mini - mental state examination ( 3ms ) ; the hopkins verbal learning test - revised ( hvlt - r ) ; digit span ( forward and backward ) from the wechsler adult intelligence scale - revised ( wais - r ) ; a generative verbal fluency test ( supermarket items ) ; the narratives from the rivermead behavioral memory test ( rbmt ) ; the brief visuospatial memory test - revised ( bvmt - r ) . \\n the mini - mental state examination ( mmse )   was extracted from 3ms . \\n alternate forms were utilized annually for the hvlt - r , rbmt , and bvmt - r on each subsequent annual visit . \\n subjects also completed the 30-item geriatric depression scale   and a self - rating scale of memory functions . \\n collateral respondents completed the dementia severity rating scale ( dsrs ) .   due to significant intercorrelations between these tests , analyses described below \\n are limited to those baseline cognitive tests that were sensitive to early changes ( i.e. , verbal learning and memory ) associated with mci / ad   or tests that were similar to those previously shown to be associated with a levels .   normative data from the cache county study was used to develop the standardized cut - off scores utilized in adapt . \\n individuals who scored below the cut scores on annual cognitive assessments underwent further dementia workup including physical and neurological examinations , laboratory studies ( i.e. , cbc , chemistry count , sedimentation rate , vitamin b12 and folic acid levels , thyroid test , and syphilis serological test ) , and neuroimaging ( i.e. , mri or ct ) , as applicable . \\n a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was also administered by a neuropsychologist as part of the dementia work - up . \\n this battery of tests consisted of the expanded consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer 's disease ( cerad ) battery ; logical memory i and ii of the wechsler memory scale - revised ; benton visual retention test   ( benton ) ; a generative fluency test ( animals ) ; control oral word association test ( cowat ; cfl ) ; the trail making test ; symbol digit modalities test ( smdt ) ; shipley vocabulary . \\n following completion of all components of the dementia work - up , a consensus team determined cognitive status using published diagnostic criteria . \\n the diagnosis of ad was made using nincds - adrda   and amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) using petersen criteria . \\n all mci patients were considered to be amnestic mci , as they only had memory impairment , but maintained normal activities of daily living and overall had a well - preserved cognition in other cognitive domains . \\n ample evidence indicates that amnestic mci patients may be in a transitional stage between normal aging and ad with 85% of these subjects converting to ad over a 7-year period . \\n additional evidence comes from an imaging study which demonstrated that the pattern of brain atrophy in amnestic mci patients is typical of that observed in ad patients . \\n it is then reasonable to combine these diagnoses in a single category , thus allowing a large enough numbers to supply statistical power . of the 215 subjects who gave blood for the ancillary study , two developed non - ad dementia , and \\n of the remaining subject pool of 208 used in these analyses , 28 subjects met criteria for either ad ( n = 10 ) or mci ( n = 18 ) in the two years following blood draw . \\n the serum a content was determined , as per manufacturer 's instructions , using the elisa kits for human a140 and a142 and the inter - assay cv , and the intraassay cv was reported to be 10% ( invitrogen , calif ) . \\n dna was extracted from whole blood for apoe genotyping using pure gene kits ( gentra systems , calif ) , and apoe genotyping was performed using previously established methods , as described elsewhere . \\n apoe genotypes were unavailable for 4 individuals , but these were included in the analyses . \\n the data set was range checked , and prior to analyses , the dependent and independent variables were examined for missing data , outliers , and violations of the normalcy assumption . \\n differences among groups on demographic variables , neuropsychological variables , and serum a140 levels were examined using either the student 's t - test or  analyses , depending on the type of variable measurement . \\n time - updated cox regression modeling was used to test whether neuropsychological test scores , a , or a combination of both can predict conversion to mci / ad in individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline . \\n potential confounding variables shown to impact risk for cognitive decline included age , education , gender , apoe status , serum creatinine , triglycerides , presence of apoe 4 allele , and history of vascular disease as determined by treatment with statins or antihypertensive medication which were entered as covariates .   the latter variables , coded dichotomously , have been previously shown to impact a levels . \\n because previous analyses revealed a nonsignificant increase of ad risk with naproxen in this cohort , we also controlled for this effect . \\n logistic regression modeling was employed to construct receiver operator curves ( roc ) to examine the predictive performance of neuropsychological measures from the baseline visit and serum a levels in diagnoses of mci / ad . \\n roc curve comparisons were based on area under the curve ( auc ) , se , and the associated 95% confidence interval ( ci ) . \\n we subsequently calculated sensitivity of the various models using the predicted probability of each subject by logistic regression modeling with specificity of at least eighty percent . \\n post hoc power calculations using the g - power software for multivariate regression analyses utilized here suggest a power of nearly 100% at the alpha value 0.05 for the current sample size , total number of predictors , and the observed effect size . \\n the mean age and education of the sample was 76.7 ( sd = 3.9 ) and 14.6 ( sd = 2.8 ) years , respectively . \\n the majority of the sample was caucasian ( 98.1% ) , and 51.9% were male . despite the cohort 's self - report of enriched family history , less than one - third of the total sample ( 31.7% ) carried at least one apoe 4 allele , a frequency similar to the general population . \\n comparisons on variables between subjects who remained cognitively normal and those who declined over the short follow - up period are reported in table 1 . \\n although all subjects at enrollment performed within the normal limits based on the established cut - off scores , those that ultimately declined had generally poorer scores on the 3ms , mmse , and all memory measures . \\n the two groups were also significantly different on serum a142 levels and a142/a140 ratios prior to diagnoses of mci / ad . \\n only 23% of the cognitively normal individuals had serum a142 in the lowest quartile compared to the nearly 50% of the diagnostic group ( 44% of mci subjects and 50% of ad subjects ) . \\n time - dependent cox regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between these cognitive tests and a on the prediction of subsequent conversion to mci / ad . \\n all neuropsychological analyses were adjusted for age , gender , and education , but no adjustment for the study medications was required as these were baseline scores . \\n cox regression analyses show that the model using neuropsychological tests predicted mci / ad ( 2 log - likelihood = 206.51 ,  = 52.11 , df = 8 , p < .001 ) . \\n significant individual neuropsychological measures were 3ms (  = 0.25  0.06 , wald = 17.78 , p < .001 ) ; generative verbal fluency (  = 0.12  0.04 , wald = 8.09 , p < \\n .004 ) ; hvlt - r scores (  = 0.24  0.11 , wald = 4.58 p < .032 ) . \\n cox regression analysis showed that a142 measured in the lowest two quartiles compared to the highest quartile was a significant individual predictor of conversion to mci / ad in this model ( 2 log - likelihood = 197.47 ,  = 38.41 , df = 15 , p < .001 ) . \\n the regression analysis utilizing the a142/a140 ratio found similarly significant results ( 2 log - likelihood = 204.69 ,  = 36.10 , df = 14 , p < .001 ) with the lowest ratios being most predictive of subsequent conversion to mci / ad . the final full model , adjusting for confound and the study medications , included hvlt -

r was observed among individuals with the lowest quartile of a142 ( 1.17 ,   2.33  sd ) and a142/a140 ratios ( 0.75 , 2.63  sd ) where individuals in the highest quartile of a142 ( 1.33 ,   1.86  sd ) and a142/a140 ratios improved by nearly one point ( 0.6  1.82 sd ) . \\n however , these differences were not statistically significant ( p > .05 ) .    for the 3ms scores , among subjects who converted to mci / ad , those with a142 in the lowest quartile declined ( 1.83  1.28  sd ) as compared to the highest quartile ( 4.83  1.35  sd ) , and this difference was statistically significant ( f = 3.42 ,  p = .033 ) .   for mci / ad subjects with the lowest quartile of the a142/a140 ratios , the 3ms values remained ultimately unchanged ( 0.16  1.20  sd ) , \\n while the scores improved among those with the highest quartile of the a142/a140 ratios ( 4.33  1.20  sd ) , and these differences were also statistically significant ( f = 3.10 , p = .046 ) .   for generative verbal fluency test , a decline was noted in both the lowest quartile ( 4.17  1.40  sd ) and the highest quartile ( 1.17  2.13  sd ) of a142 , and these differences were marginally significant ( f = 2.63 , p = .073 ) .   for a142/a140 ratios , \\n a similar pattern was observed , but this difference was not statistically significant .   among individuals who remained cognitively normal , \\n while a similar pattern was observed , those with lowest quartile of a142 and a142/a140 ratios had a larger decline than those with the highest quartile for each hvlt - r ( 0.28  0.27  sd versus . \\n 0.14  0.33  sd , respectively . ) and 3ms ( 1.02  0.51  sd versus 0.39  0.44  sd ) . \\n however , due to the small magnitude of the change in these scores , these differences were not statistically significant . \\n no such change was observed for the generative verbal fluency test ( data not shown ) . \\n examination of sensitivity and specificity using roc analysis revealed the auc for neuropsychological testing with age , education , and gender as covariates was 0.83 ( 95% ci [ 0.750.91 ] , p < .001 ) .   for a142 \\n ( adjusted for presence of apoe 4 allele , vascular risk factors , and associated medications ) , the auc was 0.79 ( 95% ci [ 0.700.88 ] , p < .001 ) .   when neuropsychological testing ( 3ms , hvlt - r , and generative verbal fluency ) and a142 were combined , the auc was increased to 0.91 ( 95% ci [ 0.860.95 ] , p < .001 ) .   for the adjusted ( as above ) a142/a140 ratios alone , \\n .001 ) , and when combined with the neuropsychological measures , auc was 0.91 ( 95%ci [ 0.870.96 ] , p < .001 ) . \\n optimal sensitivities with specificity of at least 80% predicted probabilities are shown in table 2 .   the highest sensitivity and specificity \\n was achieved using a combination of cognitive scores and a142/a140 ratio , but this finding was driven by a142 . \\n the pathogenesis of ad is initiated before the clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment and functional decline become apparent in its victims . \\n a simple and pragmatic method for identifying older adults at an increased risk for mci / ad who may benefit from targeted prevention is therefore of importance in reducing the burden of ad . \\n the combination of brief neuropsychological tests along with blood - based biomarkers of ad represents a reasonable approach with a potential for wide - scale use . \\n our findings here provide support for this notion and demonstrate that early prediction of risk for developing mci / ad may be feasible via a combination of brief neuropsychological tests and biomarkers in an at - risk cohort . in this subcohort from adapt , measures of global cognitive function ( 3ms ) , episodic memory ( hvlt - r trial 4 ) , language fluency , and serum a142/a140 ratio achieved an excellent accuracy of 91% . furthermore , sensitivity with specificity of at least 80% for the combined measures was superior to neuropsychological measures or to serum a levels alone . \\n we have recently shown that a levels alone can predict mci / ad , but a levels are influenced by vascular disease and associated medications   and require adjustment to observe the full impact of a in predictive modeling . \\n we have also shown that in subjects diagnosed with ad , there is an association between measures of language tests of fluency and object naming and a140 and that memory performance is associated with serum a142    . \\n an association between serum a140 and cognitive measures of memory and language has also been reported in cognitively normal older adults . \\n high baseline a142 and a140 with stable a142 over time is shown to be associated with diminishing cognition . \\n more recently , yaffe and colleagues demonstrated that low a142/a140 ratios predict cognitive decline over 9 years . in our study , we demonstrate that low a142 and a142/a140 ratios are associated with cognitive decline even within one year . \\n this is extremely valuable from the clinical perspective , as the ability to identify at - risk individuals within a year prior to the onset can significantly improve the quality of care and the recruitment strategy for prevention trials by redirecting those individuals who may not benefit from preventive therapies towards more suitable clinical intervention . \\n this is demonstrated by recent adapt findings , which suggest that individuals with low baseline cognitive scores converted soon after the trial initiated and that neither naproxen nor celecoxib intervention was beneficial to these individuals . \\n collectively , these findings suggest that combining cognitive tests with blood a may be useful for predicting future mci / ad , which to date has not been explored , particularly as either a or the cognitive tests alone may not have the desired sensitivity or specificity for prediction of future mci / ad . \\n this current work presented here provides evidence that the combination of brief neuropsychological tests and blood a has potential utility in predicting mci / ad at least 2 to 4 years prior to the clinical classification of mci or diagnosis of ad . \\n in addition , our findings also demonstrate the importance of accounting for factors such as apoe , vascular risk factors , and medications when using a in predicting mci / ad . \\n although at present no studies have reported sensitivity and specificity of csf a142 in predicting mci / ad conversion from normal cognition , a large multicenter study has shown that csf a142 predicts transition from mci to ad , while tau alone achieved a high sensitivity ( 83% ) with acceptable specificity ( 72% ) . \\n it is interesting to note that our findings using blood and cognitive tests , a far less invasive method , resulted in higher sensitivities and specificities for predicting cognitive decline in at - risk cognitively normal older adults . despite the limitation that blood sampling was not conducted at the same time point as the cognitive testing , \\n our data provide strong support for further evaluation of this approach , particularly as we have not seen significant fluctuations in a levels over a one - year period ( pers . \\n our study provides support that blood - based a levels may have diagnostic utility when combined with neuropsychological measures .   this proposed method warrants further investigation to determine its practical applicability in specialized clinic setting by allied health personal and in routine primary care clinics .\""

       "\" The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is expected to increase as the Baby Boomer generation ages, creating a potentially unsustainable economic burden on the healthcare system. To reduce this burden, antiamyloid agents are being developed to delay the onset or progression of AD. Neuropsychological measures have been used to identify cognitively normal elders who subsequently develop AD, but false positives are possible and interpretation of extensive testing requires expertise. Molecular imaging tracers are being developed to improve early detection.  This study examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests in combination with blood Aβ140 and Aβ142 as a predictive test for detecting MCI/AD in at-risk older adults at a pre-symptomatic stage. This approach is more practical for clinical use and could be used to design large-scale prevention trials. Participants included a subset of subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT).  Adapt was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter primary prevention trial sponsored by the National Institute on Aging. Subjects aged 70 or older with a family history of AD-like dementia and normal cognitive performance were randomly assigned to one of three groups: celecoxib, naproxen sodium, or placebo. An ancillary study involving blood draw from these subjects was initiated in 2005, and 215 subjects enrolled. Cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and annual followup visits, and the time from baseline cognitive testing to diagnosis of MCI/AD was 4.06 years. Blood was collected during semi-annual followup visits, and the timeframe from baseline cognitive testing to blood draw was 2.25 years and from blood draw to diagnosis was 1.79 years.  This study utilized a battery of cognitive tests to assess early changes associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Tests included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Span (forward and backward), a generative verbal fluency test (supermarket items), the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT) narratives, the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS). Further dementia workup included physical and neurological examinations, laboratory studies, and neuroimaging. A more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was also administered by a neuropsychologist.  A consensus team used published diagnostic criteria to determine cognitive status of 215 subjects who had completed a dementia work-up. Of these, 28 met criteria for either Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Serum A content and APOE genotyping were used to analyze the data set. The results showed that 85% of MCI patients converted to AD over a 7-year period, and imaging studies demonstrated that the pattern of brain atrophy in MCI patients was similar to that of AD patients.  This study examined differences among groups on demographic variables, neuropsychological variables, and serum A140 levels using either the Student's t-test or analyses. Time-updated Cox regression modeling was used to test whether neuropsychological test scores, A140 levels, or a combination of both can predict conversion to MCI/AD in individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline. Logistic regression modeling was employed to construct receiver operator curves (ROC) to examine the predictive performance of neuropsychological measures and serum A140 levels. The sample had a mean age of 76.7 and mean education of 14.6, and was 98.1% Caucasian. Post hoc power calculations suggest a power of nearly 100% at the alpha value 0.05.  In a cohort of individuals with a self-reported enriched family history, 51.9% were male and 31.7% carried at least one APOE4 allele, similar to the general population. Those who declined cognitively had poorer scores on neuropsychological tests and lower serum A142 levels and A142/A140 ratios. Cox regression analyses showed that the model using neuropsychological tests and A142 levels predicted MCI/AD, with significant individual predictors being 3MS, generative verbal fluency, and HVLT-R scores.  This study found that the lowest quartiles of a142 and a142/a140 ratios were most predictive of conversion to MCI/AD. The final full model included HVLT-R, fluency, 3MS, a142 levels, and a142 quartiles. Changes in HVLT-R and 3MS scores were significantly different between the lowest and highest quartiles of a142 and a142/a140 ratios, with the lowest quartiles showing the greatest decline.  A decline in both the lowest and highest quartiles of a142 was observed, and these differences were marginally significant. Neuropsychological testing combined with a142 and a142/a140 ratios had the highest sensitivity and specificity in predicting probabilities of Alzheimer's Disease, with an AUC of 0.91. This finding was driven by a142.  This study provides evidence that a combination of brief neuropsychological tests and biomarkers can accurately predict risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease in an at-risk cohort. The combination of tests and biomarkers achieved an accuracy of 91%, with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 80%. Low levels of serum A142 and A142/A140 ratios were associated with cognitive decline even within one year, making this approach valuable from a clinical perspective.  Recent findings suggest that combining cognitive tests with blood biomarkers may be useful for predicting future MCI/AD at least 2-4 years prior to diagnosis. This study found that the combination of brief neuropsychological tests and blood biomarkers had higher sensitivities and specificities for predicting cognitive decline in at-risk cognitively normal older adults than either test alone. Further evaluation of this method is needed.  This study suggests that combining blood-based A levels with neuropsychological measures may be useful in diagnosing certain conditions. Further research is needed to determine the practical applicability of this approach in specialized clinics and primary care settings.\""
